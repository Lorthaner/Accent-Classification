# Accent and gender classification

The goal of the project was to perform accent and gender classification based on audio samples taken from the Mozilla Common Voice dataset. 

Our dataset extracted from Common Voice Corpus 5.1 contains 100 random audio samples in English from 50 women and 50 men, with 10 recordings in each group from a different region of the world: Australia, England, America, India and Canada.

The neural network model used for this task was simplified as much as possible due to the high use of computer resources. 

the idea of the project was to get acquainted with the pytorch lightning framework and to learn methods of sound processing
